### Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs

### Make sure you can access the command line

If you are on Windows, you’ll need to install some software in order to use a unix-like command line

(different from the Windows built-in Command Prompt), as we mentioned previously. For more info, check out this page.

### Choose a text editor

As noted in the previous video, you should make sure to use a simple text editor like Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim, etc. and not a rich-text editor like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, so that you can easily look at your files' content on the command line.

If you don’t have one that you like yet, Sublime is a good option that will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. We have provided more detailed instructions for setting up Sublime than for other editors, and we use Sublime for all the examples in the course. You can download Sublime here.

### Make sure you can launch your editor from the command line

It will be helpful to be able to launch your text editor from the command line. See here for instructions on how to do this for Sublime. If you have trouble getting this working, videos at the end of the lesson called "Setting up Your Workspace on Windows" and "Setting Up Your Workspace on Mac" will demonstrate this process, so you can wait until then.

### Set up your course workspace

Right now, you should create a version-control directory (a more computer-science-y term for “folder”) to hold all your files for this course in an easy to remember location, then create a reflections sub-directory, and within that, create a plain text file called lesson_1_reflections.txt for the questions from this lesson.

You can do this by running the following commands in either Git Bash or the terminal (the bits after the # signs are comments, anything after those are not interpreted):
