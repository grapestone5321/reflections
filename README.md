###Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs

### Make sure you can access the command line

If you are on Windows, you’ll need to install some software in order to use a unix-like command line

(different from the Windows built-in Command Prompt), as we mentioned previously. For more info, check out this page.

### Choose a text editor

As noted in the previous video, you should make sure to use a simple text editor like Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim, etc. and not a rich-text editor like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, so that you can easily look at your files' content on the command line.
If you don’t have one that you like yet, Sublime is a good option that will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. We have provided more detailed instructions for setting up Sublime than for other editors, and we use Sublime for all the examples in the course. You can download Sublime here.
